In no particular order:

- Implement missing STATUS features.
- Use getopt to parse zfs-fuse command line args.
- Support simultaneous ioctls.
- Provide zpool/zfs SIGINT detection to ioctls (so that zfs send/recv terminates on Ctrl-C).
- Check strlcat.
- Get EFI labels working, necessary for whole disk support.
- Get zfs_fm.c to work.
- Device in use detection?
- Fix FIXMEs
- Fix TODOs
