 * _POSIX_VDISABLE has historically been defined in <sys/param.h> since

 * Subsequent versions of the IEEE Standard as well as the X/Open
 * specifications required that _POSIX_VDISABLE be defined in <unistd.h>
 * while still allowing for it's existence in other headers.  With the
 * introduction of XPG6, _POSIX_VDISABLE can only be defined in <unistd.h>.
