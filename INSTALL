Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile and use zfs-fuse, you need the following:

 * A 2.6.x Linux kernel

 * FUSE 2.5.x or greater

 * glibc version 2.3.3 or up with NPTL enabled.
   You can check if it's enabled with the following command:

   getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION

 * SCons (packaged in most distributions)
   Only needed for compilation.
   Website: http://www.scons.org

Currently, it only works on the x86 and amd64 architectures.

In order to use pools created on Solaris, you will probably need kernel
support for GPT/EFI partitions. EVMS is highly recommended in this case,
see http://evms.sourceforge.net

Compiling
---------

If you don't have SCons yet, do the usual 'sudo apt-get install scons',
'emerge scons' or 'yum install scons'.

To compile follow these steps:

  1) cd src
  2) scons

That's it!

If the compilation fails, please report a bug. See the BUGS file for
instructions.

Installing
----------

To install, run 'scons install' with appropriate privileges. It will
install the binaries in /usr/local/sbin by default.

Run 'scons install install_dir=/path/to/dir' if you want to install it in
another directory.
