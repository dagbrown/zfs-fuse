------

This is an alpha-quality release, it has received very limited testing.

What should be working:
- Creation, modification and destruction of ZFS pools, filesystems, snapshots
and clones.
- Dynamic striping (RAID-0), mirroring (RAID-1), RAID-Z and RAID-Z2.
It supports any vdev configuration which is supported by the original Solaris
implementation.
- You can use any block device or file as a vdev (except files stored inside ZFS
itself).
- Compression, checksumming, error detection, self-healing (on redundant pools).
- Quotas and reservations.

What isn't working yet (expected version):

- Mount options (0.4.0).
- File locks (0.4.0).
- zfs send/recv (0.4.0).
- ARC size is not adjustable yet, so zfs-fuse will always use up to
100 MB of RAM (0.4.0).
- Nested pools -- creating a pool on a file stored on another
pool (probably 0.4.0).
- ACLs and extended attributes (0.5.0). ACLs created in Solaris
should be enforced.
- The .zfs control directory is not working, so you can't
navigate snapshot filesystems (0.5.0). As a workaround, you can clone a
snapshot (see zfs clone).
- NFS exporting (probably 0.5.0).
- ISCSI exporting (I have no idea).

0.5.0 will probably be renamed to 1.0.0 after extensive testing.

What can't be done right now:
- Remount filesystems (FUSE limitation).
- Have better than 1-second granularity on file times (FUSE limitation).

What will probably never work:
- Storing swap files in a ZFS filesystem. This will deadlock your kernel. The
FUSE support for swap is incompatible with ZFS due to copy-on-write and
checksumming.
- ZVols - limited usefulness. Might implement it as a file in the .zfs control
dir in a future version, if people really want it (swap won't work on ZVols
anyway).
