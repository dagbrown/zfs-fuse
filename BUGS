ZFS on FUSE/Linux

Reporting bugs
--------------
If you find a bug, please report it in the following page:
https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6836

You should provide the following info in order to help me track down the bug:

  1) The problem you're encountering (if it's a compilation failure, please
provide the output of gcc)
  2) How to reproduce it
  3) The distribution you're using (and its version), OR the output of:
       # getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION
       # /lib/libc.so.6
       # gcc --version
       # uname -a

  4) If you are running the runtest.sh script and ztest crashes, it will leave
a core file in the current directory. You should provide the output of:

       # gdb ./ztest --core core.xxx (replace core.xxx with the correct
filename)
         (gdb) bt
         (gdb) bt full
         (gdb) exit

  5) If you're using the run.sh script (you should) and zfs-fuse crashes, it
will leave a core file. You should then do step 4) above (of course, replacing
"./ztest" by "./zfs-fuse")

  6) You should also provide the zfs-fuse version you are using. If you are
using Mercurial, you should provide the output of the following command instead:

       # hg identify

Thanks!
