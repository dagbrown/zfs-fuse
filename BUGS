ZFS on FUSE/Linux

Known Bugs
----------

- There's a known bug in glibc version 2.3.2 that comes in Debian Stable
  (sarge) related to conditional variables that causes a deadlock.
  You can read the details here:
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=261237
  Currently there's no known workaround (except upgrading glibc).
  (Bug reported by Eric Hill).


Reporting bugs
--------------
If you find a bug, please report it in the following page:
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6836

You should provide the following info in order to help me track down the bug:

  1) The output of the program (including the error message)
  2) If you can, tell me how to reproduce the bug
  3) The output of the following commands:
       # getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION
       # /lib/libc.so.6
       # gcc --version
       # uname -a

  4) If you are running the runtest.sh script and ztest crashes, it will leave
a core file in the current directory. You should provide the output of:

       # gdb ./ztest --core core.xxx (replace core.xxx with the correct
filename)
         (gdb) bt
         (gdb) bt full
         (gdb) exit

  4) If you're using the run.sh script (you should) and zfs-fuse crashes, it
will leave a core file. You should then do step 3) above (of course, replacing
"./ztest" by "./zfs-fuse")

  5) You should also provide the zfs-fuse version you are using. If you are
using Mercurial, you should provide the output of the following command instead:

       # hg identify

Thanks!
