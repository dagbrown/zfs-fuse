Testing
-------

If you want to run ztest, you need a directory with about 2 GB free
(be careful, it uses /tmp by default).
You should have properly cooled CPU(s) and hard drive(s).

The program, at peak times, will use about 200 threads and +200MB of RAM,
and it will intensively use your hard disk. The script will run by default
with nice level 20.

So, if you still want to run the testing program, you should do at least a
300-second test.
If you want to help make sure it's stable, you can do a 1 hour (3600-second)
test.

Testing steps:

  1) cd src/cmd/ztest
  2) ./runtest.sh -T testing-time-in-seconds [-f /directory/with/2GB/available]

If it's successful, you will receive a "Test successful" message at the end.

Don't forget to remove the ztest.* files in /tmp (or the provided directory)
after it's finished!

If the program aborts, crashes or otherwise fails, please read the information
in the BUGS file in order to report bugs.
