ZFS on FUSE/Linux README
------------------------

This project is a port of the ZFS filesystem to FUSE/Linux, done as part
of the Google Summer of Code 2006 initiative.

The project homepage is at http://www.wizy.org/wiki/ZFS_on_FUSE

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile and use zfs-fuse, you need the following:

 * SCons (packaged in most distributions)
   Website: http://www.scons.org

 * glibc version 2.3.3 or up with NPTL enabled.
   You can check if it's enabled with the following command:

   getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION

 * A 2.6.x Linux kernel

 * FUSE 2.5.x or greater

Currently, it only works on the x86 and amd64 architectures.

Compiling
---------

If you don't have SCons yet, do the usual 'sudo apt-get install scons',
'emerge scons' or 'yum install scons'.

To compile follow these steps:

  1) cd src
  2) scons

That's it!

If the compilation fails, please report a bug in the following URL:

Testing
-------

If you want to run a few tests, please read the TESTING file.

Using
-----

At this moment it is possible to mount ZFS filesystems in read-only
mode. You can also create, change properties and delete ZFS pools
and filesystems.

So, if you want to play with zfs-fuse, you must do the following:

1) Create a "/etc/zfs" directory.

Usually simply doing 'mkdir /etc/zfs' as root will do the job.

This directory is used to store a UNIX local socket, needed for the
zfs-fuse <-> zpool/zfs communication and the "zpool.cache" file that
contains the description of all known ZFS pools.

2) Start the zfs-fuse process.

This is the main daemon process that must be running at all times.

The recommended way to start it is with the provided 'run.sh' script,
which will configure 'bash' to generate core files when zfs-fuse
crashes.

You should be running it with root permissions.

3) Use the zpool and zfs commands to manage pools and filesystems.

You should backup all your data first.

You can learn about these commands at the OpenSolaris ZFS community
site: http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/

Be careful when specifying disks/partitions (as opposed to files) as
vdevs.

I won't be held responsible if you lose data - either due to mistakes,
deliberate actions or any bugs in the software!

Note that at this time you will only be able to read files, you can't
change/create files or directories yet.
