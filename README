Compiling / Installing
----------------------

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions.

Using
-----

Just to be safe, you should backup all your data before using ZFS-FUSE.

1) Start the run.sh script in src/zfs-fuse.

This will start the main zfs-fuse daemon process that must be running
at all times.
You should be running it with root permissions.

Currently ZFS-FUSE is configured to use up to 128 MB of RAM, but it can
grow larger with some usage patterns. It's recommended to have a machine
with at least 1 GB of RAM.

2) Use the zpool and zfs commands to manage pools and filesystems.

You can learn about these commands at the OpenSolaris ZFS community
site: http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/

If you find a bug, please report it. See the BUGS file for instructions.
